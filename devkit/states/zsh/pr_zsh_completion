# Setting up zsh completion
#
# The zsh package installers for most systems include completion files.
# Usually the initial fpath includes the installed completion directories.
# Thus only the pavedroad completion directories are prepended to fpath.
#
# Note that compinit will only re-initialize if the number of completion
#   files has changed.
# Other changes like name changes will not trigger a new initialization.
# In this case the dumped configuration must be manually removed:
#   rm -f ~/.zcompdump

# The pavedroad devkit installs completions in the following directors:

# Individual completion files:
ZSH_COMP_PR=/usr/local/share/zsh/completions/pavedroad

# Zsh-user completion files:
ZSH_COMP_EX=/usr/local/share/zsh/completions/extra
# See https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions
# Note that homebrew is not used to install this package on macOS

# Additional go completion files:
ZSH_COMP_GO=/usr/local/share/zsh/completions/go
# See https://github.com/zchee/zsh-completions
