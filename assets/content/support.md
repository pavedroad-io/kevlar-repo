## Getting Help

What should users do and expect when they encounter bugs or get stuck using your project? Set expectations for support, link to the issue tracker and roadmap, if applicable.

Where should users go if they have a question? (Stack Overflow, Gitter, IRC, mailing list, etc.)

If desired, you may also provide links to core contributor email addresses.
