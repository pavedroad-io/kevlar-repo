## Contributing Guidelines

Include instructions for setting up the development environment, code standards, running tests, and submitting pull requests. Aim to be inclusive and welcoming. It may be useful to link to a seperate CONTRIBUTING.md file. See this example from the Hoodie project as an exemplar: https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
